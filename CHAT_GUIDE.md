# GitHub MCP Chat Mode Guide

## Overview

The GitHub MCP Client now includes a new **Chat Mode** that provides a conversational interface for interacting with GitHub's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This mode allows for natural language interactions, making it easier and more intuitive to work with GitHub Copilot and other MCP tools.

## Starting Chat Mode

```bash
python github_mcp_client.py --chat
```

## Integration with Existing Features

Chat mode seamlessly integrates with all existing GitHub MCP Client features:

- **PR Creation**: Natural language interface for `create_pull_request_with_copilot`
- **Connection Management**: Same authentication and connection logic
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Lower Learning Curve**: No need to learn command syntax
2. **Natural Interaction**: Chat like you would with a human assistant
3. **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation state and history
4. **Flexible Input**: Multiple ways to request the same action
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Get more information as needed
6. **Offline Capability**: Useful even without server connection

## Getting Started

1. Set your GitHub token:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
   ```

2. Start chat mode:
   ```bash
   python github_mcp_client.py --chat
   ```

3. Try these first commands:
   - Say "hello" to get started
   - Type "/help" to see available commands
   - Ask "what can you do?" to learn about capabilities
   - Request "create a pull request" to try the main feature

The chat mode makes the GitHub MCP Client more accessible and user-friendly while maintaining all the powerful features of the original tool-focused interface.
